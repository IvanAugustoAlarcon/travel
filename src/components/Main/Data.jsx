    title: 'Trolltunga',
    location: 'Norway',
    description: 'For many Trolltunga is a dream, for others the most spectacular hiking trail in Norway. Trolltunga is undoubtedly an icon, a place that defies the laws of nature. It is not easy to find a place in the world that combines views at an altitude of 1,100m along with a titanic ledge where those who do not suffer from vertigo take the photo of their lives. This is Trolltunga, and today you are going to add Norway to your dream list. For Norwegians Trolltunga is the trolls tongue, a language that defies the void 700m above Lake Ringedalsvatnet. Although Trolltunga is located at 1,100m above sea level, the landscape that you will discover in this particular corner of Norway will be that of high mountains, very different from what you can find in other latitudes at the same height. After all, the 1,000m of Norway is the 2,000 or 3,000m of the Pyrenees or the Alps.'

    title: 'Fairbanks Alaska',
    location: 'USA',
    description: 'Step inside Alaska, where the unique meets the unexpected. Fairbanks exudes a kind of light, energy and warmth that cannot be found anywhere else on the planet. It is not just our northern lights, which will change you, or our midnight sun, which will enchant you. It is also the soft glow of a three-story ice sculpture, reflecting in our rivers or shining through the windows of a rustic cabin five minutes from downtown. That is how it is. When we say that nature is within arm is reach, it means that we only have to stretch out our arm to open a door and access it. Where else can you live in the midst of such majestic and pristine wilderness, while enjoying the comforts and energy of a vibrant city, a thriving arts community, a rich arctic culture, a premier university, and abundant business opportunities? Where else can you experience the warmth of natural hot springs in sub-zero temperatures? Our very long summers of 32ºC also help. No matter what activities you choose to engage in while you are here, you wont leave without experiencing the light, energy, and warmth of Fairbanks.'

    title: 'Golden Circle',
    location: 'Iceland',
    description: 'The Golden Circle route in Iceland covers three of the most visited sites in this country: the Gullfoss waterfall, the geysers in the Haukadalur valley and the Thingvellir National Park. The Gullfoss Waterfall is one of the most spectacular in the world, as it was formed from the rupture of the tectonic plates in Iceland. The 32-meter waterfall creates a deafening sound as it falls into an impressive natural canyon. In the Haukadalur Valley are six of the thousand geysers on Earth. Witnessing the moment when the towering geysers emit the fiery column of steam is a spectacle that you cannot miss. The last element of the Golden Circle is the Thingvellir National Park, where two impressive tectonic faults meet that, together with the volcanic and rocky landscape, make this park a wonderful setting.'
